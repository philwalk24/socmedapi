# social network app

## Description 
This app is supposed to allow the user to interact with people in a database by adding and deleting people, making friends with people, and having thoughts and reactions to those thoughts. I couldnt get the thing to createThoughts and i dont have time for bug fixing, but i know its close.

## Installation
Clone the repo and then you can run npm i. After that you should be able to npm start and then open up insomnia.

## Usage
This app is entirely used in insomnia, making PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE requests. I think my app can do most of them, but there was a bug with the thoughts one.

## Credits
The module 18 code helped me, but it was not enough as I couldnt get it 100% working. But I feel this is still a good enough assignment.
